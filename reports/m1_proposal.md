Marci is the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth of Canada, and she is interested in developing new policies to improve gender equality in the workplace in Canada. Specifically, she is keen to explore improving gender equality in top-level management positions. Since she is in the beginning phases of policymaking, she wants to be able to get an overview of the proportion of females and males in top-level managerial positions in different industries in Canada. To make the most efficient use of her ministry's resources, she wants to be able to identify specific provinces and industries which are performing exceptionally well or badly in terms of gender inequality in these positions. This information will help her to decide on which stakeholders to consult in the policymaking process, as well as to consider which provinces and industries she should concentrate her efforts in.

Beginning stages of policymaking - what subsets might be most problematic, how trend is evolving across time in that province/sector, what interventions might they want to consider/stakeholders to consult

-   Then, think about what they might want to do with your app and write small user story. User stories are typically written in a narrative style and include:
    -   The specific context/background of the user
    -   The overall goal of the user
    -   Tasks needed to reach that goal
    -   A hypothetical walkthrough of how the user would accomplish those tasks with your app
    -   The outcome/action that the user would take based on the information they find in the app
