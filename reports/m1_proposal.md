# 1. Motivation and purpose
Our role: data science consultants
Target audience: employment policy makers

There is a lot of data on gender biases in employment and on gender bias in leadership roles. Our dashboard can be used as a tool to explore this data. 
Since our dashboard will allow for interactivity by filtering based on year, province, industry, etc, it could allow policy makers to identify where gender biases might be most extreme/most important to address. 
Our tool will save policy makers time by presenting the data in an easy to use and interpretable manner which will help them to make efficient use of resources. This prevents them from having to do the "groundwork" of getting data and cleaning it etc which is not how policy makers should be spending their time. Furthermore, our dashboard will summarise important information so that policymakers can easily explore both general and specific trends in gender representation interactively.
