# 1. Motivation and purpose

Our role: data science consultants
Target audience: employment policy makers

There is a lot of data on gender biases in employment and on gender bias in leadership roles. Our dashboard can be used as a tool to explore this data. 
Since our dashboard will allow for interactivity by filtering based on year, province, industry, etc, it could allow policy makers to identify where gender biases might be most extreme/most important to address. 
Our tool will save policy makers time by presenting the data in an easy to use and interpretable manner which will help them to make efficient use of resources. This prevents them from having to do the "groundwork" of getting data and cleaning it etc which is not how policy makers should be spending their time. Furthermore, our dashboard will summarise important information so that policymakers can easily explore both general and specific trends in gender representation interactively.

# 3. Research questions

Marci is the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth of Canada, and she is interested in developing new policies to improve gender equality in the workplace in Canada. Specifically, she is keen to explore improving gender equality in top-level management positions. Since she is in the beginning phases of policymaking, she wants to be able to get an overview of the proportion of females and males in top-level managerial positions in different industries in Canada. To make the most efficient use of her ministry's resources, she wants to be able to identify specific provinces and industries which are performing exceptionally well or badly in terms of gender inequality in these positions. This information will help her to decide on which stakeholders to consult in the policymaking process, as well as to consider which provinces and industries she should concentrate her efforts in.

When Marci opens our 'Girl Boss' app, she will see a map of Canada, which she can use as a filtering tool to choose which province(s) she wants to look at. She can also choose which industries and time periods she wants to examine. Based on the selected subset, she will be able to view graphs showing both the overall gender makeup of the top-level positions in that province, and in each industry. In addition, she will also be able to see how the trends have changed over time, using the time period she has selected. After exploring different subsets, Marci realizes that the construction industry has shown marked improvement in gender equality from 2017 to 2020 on the whole, while the energy industry in British Columbia seems to have had disproportionally more men in top-level leadership positions all this time. In fact, she realizes that, after the pandemic in 2020, the gap between males and females in executive positions in the energy industry in BC increased dramatically, and this alarms her.

As a result, Marci decides to consult industry leaders and experts in the construction industry to understand the changes they made to encourage more gender-equal outcomes, while commissioning a directorate based in British Columbia to investigate ways to improve gender equality in the province, with a special focus on the energy industry.

# 4. App sketch and description

The app contains the landing page which shows the graph containing the % of women in the top leadership positions for all the provinces in Canada. The left-hand side of the page contains the filters to be applied to dive further. Filter options are available for province, year, and checklist for the corporation type and industries. The user can select a specific province to look into or restrict the year for which they want to consider the data. The province can be selected by clicking on the map or by using the dropdown. The top right corner displays the overall percentage of women and men and based on the filters applied, these numbers would be updated. Just below these overall numbers, we have 2 graphs, a pie chart showing the distribution across industries and a bar graph showing the distribution across the corporation types. We also have a line graph below the map which depicts the yearly trend showing the % of women and men at the top positions.
