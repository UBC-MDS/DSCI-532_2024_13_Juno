# Reflections

## Things Implemented:

### Widgets

We chose three filters (Year, Industry, and Province) to avoid overcomplicating the dashboard, while still providing useful demographic-based breakdowns of the data.

### Charts

Cards at the top of the dashboard show the overall proportion of males and females in the subsetted data, allowing users to retain some sense of the overall picture in the subset.

The line chart displays the trend of the number women and men in a given industry from 2016 to 2020. Its interactive tooltip, allowa us to get readings over the chart and a drop down to select the industry.

The first bar chart shows the number of males and females in top positions across the different types of corporations. The second bar chart displays the gender breakdown across different industries. Both charts can be filtered by province and year and have interactive tooltips, providing easy-to-read callouts, improves accessibility for readers with poor eyesight.

### Footer

We added a footer providing context about the goals of our app and a link to our GitHub repository, so that users will understand its purpose, and can easily find out more about our project. This is at the bottom as it is not the focus of our app.

### Changes

We replaced our pie chart with a bar chart, which we found more effective in conveying trends in the data.

Instead of using percentages in the graphs, we used absolute numbers. The number of observations in different subsets varies widely, so absolute numbers would provide users more context.

## To Be Implemented:

We did not include the map showing the percentage of women in top positions in each province. Given the short timeline for submission, we focused on producing a minimum viable product to the best of our ability with the simpler charts for now.

## Strengths and Improvements

Our dashboard has an accessible, minimalist, and easy-to-use interface. Our filters were useful in subsetting the data in interesting ways, and the cards and graphs all work as expected. Our graphs also change in title based on the filters chose, which provides convenience to users who might want an easy way to check what filters they are using.

Our app currently has only 3 charts and 1 set of cards, providing only a few options for exploring the data. We might include more diverse charts, like stacked bar charts, or a section allowing users to deep dive into statistics and compare statistics from the subset to the national average.

We can test our app's layout with our peers to get feedback on its navigability. Labels and headers explaining how our motivations for creating the different graphs might also help users with navigability. We might change the colour scheme to match the context of our data (for example, using blue and pink instead of orange), or to improve visibility for colour blind users.

Lastly, we could add stylistic elements, like an icon for our app or changing the font, to add visual interest and make our dashboard memorable.
