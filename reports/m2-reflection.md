## Reflections
# 1. Pie Chart:
Instead of creating side by side charts for men and women, a single chart has been created with the freedom to choose the year and the industry to see the percentage of women and men working in a particular inductry given the year.

# 2. Line Chart:
The line chart created shows us the trend of the number women and men in a given industry over a period of 5 years from 2016 to 2020. The chart has an interactive tooltip, allowing us to get readings over the chart and a drop down to select the industry.
