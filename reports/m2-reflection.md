## What We Have Implemented:

### Widgets

As stated in our proposal, we decided to incorporate the following filters as drop down menus: Year, Industry, and Province. We chose just three filters to avoid overcomplicating the dashboard, while still providing useful demographic-based breakdowns of the data.

### Charts

The line chart created shows us the trend of the number women and men in a given industry over a period of 5 years from 2016 to 2020. The chart has an interactive tooltip, allowing us to get readings over the chart and a drop down to select the industry.

### Notable Changes

We included a pie chart of the different industries in our first sketch, but after discussion and initially implementing it, we decided that it was not a very useful tool in understanding the trends in the dataset. We thus decided to replace it with an additional bar chart, showing the gender makeup by industry instead. We feel that this highlights the disparity in the number males and females more effectively.

Instead of highlighting the percentage of females and males in the bar charts, we also decided to highlight the numbers instead. This is as the number of observations in different subsets varies widely, and in the light of this, we felt that just showing the proportion by percentage might be deceptive. Absolute numbers would provide users more context, which we found more helpful.

## What We Have Not Implemented Yet:

One notable missing chart is the geospatial static map showing the

## Future Improvements and Additions

Limitations

what its limitations are, and what are good potential future improvements and additions.

# 1. Pie Chart:

Instead of creating side by side charts for men and women, a single chart has been created with the freedom to choose the year and the industry to see the percentage of women and men working in a particular inductry given the year.

# 2. Line Chart:
