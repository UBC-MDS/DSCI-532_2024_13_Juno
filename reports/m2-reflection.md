# Reflections

## What We Have Implemented:

### Widgets

As stated in our proposal, we decided to incorporate the following filters as drop down menus: Year, Industry, and Province. We chose just three filters to avoid overcomplicating the dashboard, while still providing useful demographic-based breakdowns of the data.

### Cards

As stated, we included cards at the top of the dashboard to show the overall proportion of males and females in the subsetted data, allowing users to retain some sense of the overall picture in the subset, even as they dive into different sections in the summary graphs.

### Charts

The line chart created shows us the trend of the number women and men in a given industry over a period of 5 years, from 2016 to 2020. It has an interactive tooltip, allowing us to get readings over the chart and a drop down to select the industry. This allows users to have a look at the trend over time even as they look at year-based data in the other charts.

The first bar chart shows the number of males and females in top positions across the different types of corporations. It can be filtered by year and province. The second bar chart displays the gender breakdown across different industries, and can also be filtered by province and year. Both charts have interactive tooltips, providing easy-to-read callouts. This improves accessibility for readers with poor eyesight.

### Footer

We added a footer providing context about the goals of our app and a link to our GitHub repository, so that users who might stumble across this dashboard will understand its purpose, and can easily find out more about our project. We put this at the bottom as we feel the focus should be on the summary graphs and statistics.

### Notable Changes

We included a pie chart of the different industries in our first sketch, but after discussion and initially implementing it, we decided that it was not a very useful tool in understanding the trends in the dataset. We thus decided to replace it with an additional bar chart, showing the gender makeup by industry instead. We feel that this highlights the disparity in the number males and females more effectively.

Instead of highlighting the percentage of females and males in the bar charts, we also decided to highlight the numbers instead. This is as the number of observations in different subsets varies widely, and in the light of this, we felt that just showing the proportion by percentage might be deceptive. Absolute numbers would provide users more context, which we found more helpful.
