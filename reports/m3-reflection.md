# Reflections

## Planned Features

As mentioned previously, this week, we implemented a static map showing a heat map of the proportion of women in leadership positions in each province.

## Feedback

Based on our feedback session with Joel, we added ratios of females to males to allow for an easier comparison of trends in gender inequality over time and across the different provinces and industries. In addition, we added a national average to the line chart to provide users with context to compare the provinces they selected with. We also changed our layout to reflect the fact that only the cards change with the industry filter. Lastly, we edited the formatting and style of our dashboard to be more aesthetically pleasing, and to fit with our theme. We chose to use green and purple as we did not want to use the typical blue-pink combination which would reinforce gender norms, but wanted to retain good contrast between the colors. Green and purple seemed suitable as we like the look of the colors, and they can also symbolize money and royalty respectively, which ties in well with the theme of top business leaders.

Based on peer feedback, we also added a short description about the purpose of our dashboard and name to the dashboard to clarify our motivations, as well as a caveat about missing subsets of data in our dataset to explain why filters may seem to not be working. In addition, we reformatted the charts so that except for the map, they can be viewed without scrolling.

On the coding side, we modularized our code, making the app.py script cleaner and more readable, while also preventing the file from growing too big.

## Strengths and Improvements

The new chloropleth looks good and provides important context, as well as a good general overview of each province's performance, which we believe will be useful to users. We are happy with the formatting changes we made, and grateful for the feedback which sparked these changes.

We are planning to add one more card to show the overall ratio of females to males in the subset, and potentially, to make the separation between the cards and charts clearer by adding a border. Furthermore, if it is feasible, we might add the text to a pop-up menu to minimize the need for scrolling. We might also make minor formatting changes in the coming week.
