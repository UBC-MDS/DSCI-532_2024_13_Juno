# Reflections

## Planned Features

As mentioned previously, this week, we implemented a static map showing a heat map of the proportion of women in leadership positions in each province.

## Feedback

Based on our feedback session with Joel, we added ratios of females to males to allow for an easier comparison of trends in gender inequality over time and across the different provinces and industries. In addition, we added a national average to the line chart to provide users with context to compare the provinces they selected with. We also changed our layout to reflect the fact that only the cards change with the industry filter.
