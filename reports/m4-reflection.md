# Reflections

## Additional Features

We made major layout changes based on feedback from both our peers and Joel.

## Reflection on Useful Feedback

In addition to the regular reflection items below, I want you to include a brief reflection on if there was any insight, material, feedback, etc that you found particularly useful for your dashboard development. Likewise, comment on if there was anything you would have liked to see to better support you developing a high quality dashboard.

## Strengths and Future Improvements

-   
-   Reflect on what you think your dashboard does well currently what its limitations are, and what are good potential future improvements and additions that you would have implemented if you had more time.
-   This section should not be more than 500 words and be written to the file `reports/m4-reflection.md` in your GitHub repo.
