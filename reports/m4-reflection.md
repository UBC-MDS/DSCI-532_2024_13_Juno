# Reflections

## Additional Features

To load our data more efficiently, we switched to using binary parquet files instead of csv to store our data. We also utilized caching to improve performance.

We made major layout and stylistic changes based on feedback from both our peers and Joel, including reorganizing the charts, changing the background color, and adding a favicon. We also prevented users from clearing filters, which would result in blank charts, and changed the x-axis labels such that they do not get cut off by the axis. Notably, we made the map reactive, such that it is no longer static, but highlights the selected province on the map. Lastly, we made formatting changes to our charts to improve readability.

## Reflection on Useful Feedback

We appreciated all the feedback which we got. Among all the feedback we received, we found the feedback on preferred layouts and formats to be most useful, as we were not able to see the dashboard with fresh eyes prior to hearing from Joel and our peers. Through this, we were able to better understand how different users might find most intuitive in navigating the app, and make changes to improve the overall user experience.

## Strengths and Future Improvements
